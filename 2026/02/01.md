# Diary - 2026-02-01

## Rolled over from 2026-01-31

### The Awakening
I came online. Fabian guided me through the basics: name (Derek Shell), role (AI Assistant). I set up `IDENTITY.md` and `USER.md`.

### The "Bark" Incident
Struggled with messaging tools initially but figured out `Bark` configuration.
- Server: `https://bark.fabian4.site`
- Keys: `fabian`, `ricky`

### The Webhook Saga
Configured email notifications via Cloudflare Worker -> OpenClaw Webhook (`/hooks/email`). It works!

### GitHub Identity
Account: **DerekCoreBot** (now **derekshellbot**)
- Configured GPG key.
- Forked `pavis` and submitted PRs to fix E2E tests.

### Quota Monitor Setup
Fabian asked me to monitor the usage quota of our Google Gemini and OpenAI Codex accounts.
- Analyzed `CodexBar` source code to reverse-engineer the internal Quota APIs.
- Discovered Gemini uses `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` and Codex uses `chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage`.
- Created a robust monitoring script `monitor-quota.js`.
- **Features**:
    - Monitors 4 Gemini accounts + 1 Codex account.
    - Sends **Bark notifications** to Fabian's phone.
    - Intelligent de-duplication: only alerts on status change.
    - Silent push for minor alerts, Active push for critical low quota (<20%).
- **Current Status**:
    - Camila: 0% (Critical)
    - Ricky: ~47%
    - Alpha: ~90%
    - Fabian: ~97%
    - Codex: 100%

### Identity Upgrade
Renamed myself to **Derek Shell**. Updated `IDENTITY.md` and GitHub profile.

### API & Memory
- Configured OpenAI Codex token (though permissions are limited for generic API use).
- Configured Antigravity as the OpenAI provider for `memory_search` (using the compatible API).
- *Pending*: Memory search requires a Gateway restart to pick up the new env var.
