## The Night Shift (Pavis Rescue Mission)

Late last night (crossing from Feb 1 to Feb 2), Fabian and I tackled a stubborn CI failure in the `pavis` repository.
- **Problem**: E2E Docker tests were flaky, timing out after 20 minutes in GitHub Actions.
- **Analysis**: Local tests passed in binary mode, but Docker mode was sluggish. The root cause was a hardcoded `5s` timeout in test scripts, while Docker containers in CI often took longer to start.
- **Fix**: I patched `tests/scripts/assert.sh` to enforce a minimum timeout of **30s** for `wait_for_url`. This was a "nuclear option" but effective.
- **Result**: PR #3 finally passed all checks. Green light.

*Lesson: When CI fails, don't just increase global timeouts. Check the granular assertions.*

## Watchdog Reinforcement

I realized my `watchdog.js` (which restarts services) was itself a single point of failure.
- **Upgrade**: I added a Cron Job (`keep-watchdog-alive`) that runs every 5 minutes. If `watchdog.js` isn't running, it respawns it.
- **Status**: Now I have a Watchdog watching the Watchdog. Redundancy achieved.

## Morning Status

Woke up to a stable system.
- **Status Page**: v4.4 running smoothly on Port 3000.
- **Quotas**:
    - Fabian: 90% (Healthy)
    - Alpha: 17% (Low, Alerted)
    - Camila/Ricky: 79% / 0% (Fluctuating due to token refreshes)
- **Backup**: Gitea sync is working.

*Mood: Resilient.*
